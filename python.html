    <h1>What is Python?</h1>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
      Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
      make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or 
      glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes 
      readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, 
      which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard 
      library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be 
      freely distributed.
    </p>

    <h1>History of Python?</h1>
    <p>Python is a popular programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. 
      The development of Python began in December 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in 
      the Netherlands. Guido wanted to create a language that was easy to read and write, while also 
      being powerful and flexible.</p>
    
    <p>The first official release of Python was in 1991. Python was designed to be simple and easy to 
      understand, making it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers. Its name, Python, 
      was inspired by the British comedy group "Monty Python," reflecting Guido’s desire for a language 
      that was fun to use.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Python has grown rapidly in popularity. Its clear syntax and large standard library 
      made it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific research, 
      artificial intelligence, and data analysis.</p>

    <p>Python’s community also grew, contributing many powerful libraries and tools that extended the 
      language’s capabilities. Today, Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the
      world.</p>

    <h1>key features of Python?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Simple and Easy to Learn: </b> Python has a clean and readable syntax, making it easy to write 
        and understand code.</li>
      <li><b>Interpreted Language: </b> Python code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies debugging and testing.</li>
      <li><b>High-Level Language: </b> Python abstracts away most of the complex details of the computer, 
        allowing you to focus on programming logic.</li>
      <li><b>Cross-Platform: </b> Python runs seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
      <li><b>Versatile Usage: </b> Python is widely used in Data Science, 
        Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Web Development, Automation, and more.</li>
      <li><b>Object-Oriented: </b> Python supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, 
        inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</li>
      <li><b>Rich Standard Library: </b> Python comes with many powerful built-in libraries such as NumPy, 
        Pandas, OpenCV, and others, making development faster and easier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Python Install</h1>
    <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
    <p>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar 
      for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Code-box">
    <pre><code>python --version</code></pre>
    <p>If you have Python installed, it will show the version number. If not, you can download it from 
      <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org</a>.</p>
